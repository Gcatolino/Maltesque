\section{Workshop Format}
\label{sec:format}

The workshop will follow a one-day format, consisting of 3 to 4 sessions, depending on the number of papers accepted for publication.
The workshop is intended to be highly interactive: for this reason, each accepted paper will have a maximum of 15/20 minutes for the presentation, followed by 10/15 minutes for questions and discussion.
We hope that the workshop will foster and promote collaboration, and there will be some time set aside to support this.

We also plan to invite a keynote speaker who will be selected as a kind of advertisement to raise the public profile of the workshop and attract more people to attend and submit their research.
It means that the person chosen will be a well-known personality in that particular topic.

Finally, the accepted papers will be part of the ESEC/FSE proceedings and available for participants in advance through a workshop webpage and in the ACM digital library.
