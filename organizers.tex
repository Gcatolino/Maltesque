\section{Organizers}

The organizers are all researchers with a software engineering and machine learning background.
We propose a team composed by a senior member, \ie Prof. Foutse Khom and junior members, \ie Dr. Gemma Catolino, and Dr. Pasquale Salza.

\label{sec:organizers}
\subsection{Gemma Catolino}
Dr. Gemma Catolino is a post-doctoral researcher at the Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands.
In 2020, she received the European Ph.D. Degree from the University of Salerno, Italy.
Her research interests include human factors in software maintenance and evolution, empirical software engineering, source code quality, and mining software repositories.
She serves and has served as a program committee member of various international conferences and as referee for flagship journals in the fields of software engineering.
She received the best Master's thesis award from the Italian Software Metrics Association in 2016 and a gold medal for the Microsoft Student Research Competition in 2018 at the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Mobile Software Engineering and Systems.\\
