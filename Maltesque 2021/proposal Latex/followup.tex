\section{Follow-Up Plans}

We are also planning to reserve time during the workshop in order to open a discussion with all participants.
This discussion aims at producing, as tangible outcome, a manuscript that describes the grand challenges and roadmap for future research in the field of machine learning for software quality evaluation and the engineering of systems embedding machine learning components.
For instance, a possible grand challenge could be the responsibility of machine learning in society and research (\eg when it is useful and when not) as well as which could be new areas in software engineering where machine learning techniques could be exploited or re-adapted.
The produced manuscript will be submitted as a vision paper to a conference or journal.

Finally, we plan to invite the workshop papers to extend their work in a special issue of a well-established journal in the field of software engineering.
The last year, we opened a collaboration with the Journal of Software and Systems (EMSE), edited by Springer.
The last year's special issue is still undergoing, yet it received more than X submissions.
