\section{Objective and Topics}
\label{sec:objective}

In the following, we describe the objective of the proposed workshop and the topics we envision for the next edition.

\subsection{Objective}

The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss new ideas, trends and results concerning the application of machine learning methods for software quality evaluation, and the application of software engineering techniques to self-learning systems.
We expect that the workshop will help with:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the validation of existing machine learning methods for software quality evaluation as well as their application to novel contexts;
    \item the effectiveness evaluation of machine learning methods, both compared to other automated approaches and the human judgment;
    \item the adaptation of machine learning approaches already used in other areas of science in the context of software quality;
    \item the design of new techniques to validate software based on machine learning, inspired by traditional software engineering techniques.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Topics}

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item application of machine-learning in software quality evaluation;
    \item analysis of multi-source data;
    \item knowledge acquisition from software repositories;
    \item adoption and validation of machine learning models and algorithms in software quality;
    \item decision support and analysis in software quality;
    \item prediction models to support software quality evaluation;
    \item validation and verification of systems, learning;
    \item validation and verification of systems based on machine learning;
    \item automated machine learning;
    \item design of safety-critical learning software;
    \item integration of learning systems in software ecosystems.
\end{itemize}
