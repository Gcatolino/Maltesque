\section{Submission}
\label{sec:submissions}

We are looking for two different types of papers; the first one, \ie technical papers, where we invite to submit original research (even at early stages of evaluation) on how machine learning and software quality assurance can support each other.
Papers must not exceed four 6 pages for the main text, including figures, tables, appendices, and references.
They will be part of the ESEC/FSE proceedings and available for participants in advance through a workshop webpage.

The second one, \ie presentation abstracts, which have to report the research results that have already been published, or that are ready to be submitted to a conference or a journal.
They will only be reviewed for relevance, and will not be included in the MaLTeSQuE proceedings.
When accepted, the 2 pages will be made available on the website of the workshop.

We expect industrial practitioners to submit the summaries on the use of machine learning for software quality, with the purpose of stimulating the discussion, initiate challenging new avenues, etc.

All papers should be submitted in the PDF format, conforming to the ACM conferences template, through HotCRP.com.
To attract participants for this workshop, we will distribute its call for paper in mailing lists related to the communities of software engineering and machine learning.
The desired number of participants ranges from 20-25 participants.
Selected papers will be invited to be extended in a special issue of a well-established journal in the field of software engineering.

\subsection{Review Process}
The process for paper submission and evaluation will be similar to the ESEC/FSE one.
Therefore, all submitted papers will undergo a rigorous peer review process, with emphasis on their originality, quality, soundness and relevance.
In the same way as ESEC/FSE, the workshop will follow a double-blind review process, where three program committee members will review the submitted papers.
Afterwards, the program committee will jointly make the final decision concerning the acceptance of individual papers, based on the reviews.

\subsection{Program Committee (the list is not definitive)}
The program committee members are selected among both senior and junior researchers working on the topics of the workshop with the aim of (a) ensuring a high review quality, (b) supporting the emergence of junior researchers in the community and (c) attract established researchers from communities related to artificial intelligence and machine learning.
The program committee members are:
