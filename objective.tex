\section{Objective and Topics}
\label{sec:objective}
\subsection{Objective}
The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss new ideas, trends and results concerning the application of ML methods to software quality evaluation and the application of software engineering techniques to self-learning systems. We expect that the workshop will help in (1) the validation of existing ML methods for software quality evaluation as well as their application to novel contexts, (2) the effectiveness evaluation of ML methods, both compared to other automated approaches and the human judgement, (3) the adaptation of ML approaches already used in other areas of science in the context of software quality, (4) the design of new techniques to validate ML- based software, inspired by traditional software engineering techniques.
\subsection{Topics}
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Application of machine-learning in software quality evaluation,\smallskip
\item Analysis of multi-source data,\smallskip
\item Knowledge acquisition from software repositories,\smallskip
\item Adoption and validation of machine learning models and algorithms in software quality,\smallskip
\item Decision support and analysis in software quality,\smallskip
\item Prediction models to support software quality evaluation,\smallskip
\item Validation and verification of systems, learning,\smallskip
\item Automated machine learning,\smallskip
\item Design of safety-critical learning software,\smallskip
\item Integration of learning systems in software ecosystems.
\end{itemize}
